__ABSTRACT__
The use of skin virome for human identification purposes offers a unique approach to instances where a viable and statistically relevant human DNA profile is unavailable. The skin virome may act as an alternative DNA profile and/or an additional form of probative genetic material. To date, no study has attempted to investigate the human virome over a time series across various physical locations of the body to identify its potential as a tool for human identification. For this study, we set out to evaluate the stability, diversity, and individualization of the human skin virome. An additional goal was to identify viral signatures that can be used in conjunction with traditional forensic STR loci. In order to accomplish this, human virome metagenomes were collected and sequenced from 42 individuals at three anatomical locations (left hand, right hand, and scalp) across multiple collection periods over a 6-month window of time. Assembly dependent and independent bioinformatic approaches were employed, along with a database-based assessment, which resulted in three sets of stable putative viral markers. In total, with the three sets combined, 59 viral species and uncharacterized viral genome assemblies were identified as being significantly stable (P=5.3x10^-15). Viral diversity, based on presence or absence, is significantly different across subjects (P<0.001). Here we demonstrate that not only is the human virome applicable to be used for human identification, but we have identified many viral signatures that can be used for forensic applications, thus providing a foundation to the novel field of forensic virology.
